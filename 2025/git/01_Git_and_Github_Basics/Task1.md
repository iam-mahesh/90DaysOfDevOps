## Task 1: Fork and Clone the Repository
- Fork the Repository:
- Clone Your Fork Locally:


- Forked the 90DaysOfDevOps repository.

- Cloning the forked repository locally

        1) Cloned the forked repository using HTTPS:

        git clone https://github.com/iam-mahesh/90DaysOfDevOps.git

        2) Change directory into the cloned repository:

        cd 2025/git/01_Git_and_Github_Basics

## What is Clone -
    - Clone is making the copy of the remote repository to our local
    - We use the "git clone <repo url that want to clone>"

## What is Fork - 
    - If we do not want to make a copy of a specific repository to local 
    - But, want to keep a copy on a remote i.e. githu, then we do a fork on a github.
